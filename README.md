1) No, I wouldn't use a unit test on the "mesage" feature. This is because unit testing is great for debugging on a small scale without many working components, and a "message" feature would have many different parts which make up a larger application as a whole.
2) Yes, since unit tests are meant to test indivudal components of a program, using it to test the "max message length" feature would be beneficial.
